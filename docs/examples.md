## Prediction of Monthly SST

We provide an example of how to use the `st_encoder_decoder` module to predict
monthly sea surface temperature (SST) using a spatio-temporal encoder-decoder
architecture. The example is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, which can be
found in the `notebooks` directory.
